# IDEs and code editors

Writing Python on the terminal window is great for simple things, but not practical when it comes to larger programming projects. Using an IDE, or even just a good dedicated code editor, will facilitate programming tasks with much ease and makes coding fun. 

## What are IDEs and code editors?

An IDE (or Integrated Development Environment) is a program dedicated to software development. As the name implies, IDEs integrate several tools specifically designed for software development. These tools usually include:

+ An editor designed to handle code (with, for example, syntax highlighting and auto-completion)
+ Build, execution, and debugging tools
+ Some form of source control

In contrast, a dedicated code editor can be as simple as a text editor with syntax highlighting and code formatting capabilities. Compared to an IDE, a good dedicated code editor is usually smaller and quicker, but often less feature rich.

## List of IDEs and code editors

Below is a list of some general purpose tools as well as Python-specific editors/IDEs we can use for Python development.
