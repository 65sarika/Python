# What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python can be freely distributed and supports all major platforms 

## What do I need

Python comes with an interpreter that runs in a terminal window, allowing you to try bits of Python without having to save and run an entire program. The Python interpreter is freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python [web site](https://www.python.org/), and may be freely distributed. 

*Note: On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named python, so that it does not conflict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.*


## Installing Python
You can download Python from the [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After youâ€™ve downloaded the file, run the installer.


## Running Python

### Windows
1. Launch a command/powershell window.

2. Type `python` and press `Enter`. You should see something like this:




### Mac/Linux
1. Launch a terminal window. 

2. Type `python3` and press `Enter`. You should see something like this:

3. Type `print('Hello world!')` after prompt (`>>>`) and press `Enter`. You should see the output being printed.

4. Type `exit()` and press `Enter` to get out of Python interpreter.



## Summary

You've learn a bit about Python and able to run Python code in a terminal session.
